A simple multi-page resume template. I prepared it according to some [general guidelines](http://dcetin.me/en/blog/how-to-write-a-good-cv) I had in mind.

The template was originally based on [that of Sourabh Bajaj](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume), which is also worth a look. Similarly, I use the MIT license, but all the data is owned by me.
