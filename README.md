# Resume

A minimalistic, multi-page CV/resume template. I prepared it according to some [general guidelines](http://dcetin.me/en/blog/how-to-write-a-good-cv) I had in mind. The template was originally based on [that of Sourabh Bajaj](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume), which is also worth a look.

## Usage

Supports Chinese and Cyrillic characters, just need to uncomment relevant lines in the preamble.
Different color themes can be applied by choosing them appropriately in the main file.

## Preview
