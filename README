# Simple-CV

This CV is based on the excellent template by [Doruk Cetin](https://github.com/dcetin/Simple-CV). Follow the instructions on that page for complete examples.

## Usage

Feel free to clone my repository and generate your own CV by changing the content. Note that the template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
Code is tested on Linux with `pdflatex` using TeXlive. The bibliography is generated using the BibLaTeX package, and you will need to run `biber` to make it work.
